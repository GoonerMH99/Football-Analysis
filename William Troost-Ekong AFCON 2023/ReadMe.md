A python project in which i used the free event data of the Africa Cup of Nations 2023 games which was provided by Statsbomb.

This project aimed to highlight the performance of the MVP of the tournament William Troost-Ekong

I managed to highlight his most impressive defensive metrics and visualized them by a Radar chart, and also his contributions to support his teammates in the attacking aspect
was visualized by a heatmap of his ball receipt positions.
